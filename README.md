# About
`inside-emacs` is a **complementary material** for the video series **inside emacs**.

Watch [here](https://youtu.be/F1IXixEhQwk).

# Content

If you want to reproduce some of the actions made in **inside
emacs** videos, here you'll find:

1. Various list of the commands I use in the videos and the packages
   they belong to,
2. The code of the customized commands I use in the videos (I put them
   in `utils.el` file in the corresponding subdirectories of the
   [src](./src/) directory), they generaly are prefixed by `ta-`
   (stands for Tony Aldon),
3. When it's possible, the files I use to make the videos (see the
   [src](./src/) directory).

# Motivation

1. I want to take some live notes on my `emacs` workflow.
2. I want to own the best `emacs` commands, I want them to be part of me
   and want to be able to play with them as a musician would do.
3. I love `emacs` but I doesn't want to think about it when I'm using
   it. Therefore I take time out of my schedule to learn it. These
   videos are part of this learning process.

My main goal doing these videos is to be **quicker**, **clearer** and
more **fluent** when I **read**, **modify** or **write** code.

I hope these videos can help you in your `emacs` trip.

# Great video series

I've learnt a lot of emacs cool stuff from [magnars](https://github.com/magnars) and
